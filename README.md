Fortify Project is a JavaScript application that interacts with Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. The user can search for a specific recipe and save it to a favorite list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease serving per his need and view detailed directions. You can add your own recipe to the list, it will be automatically added to your bookmarks and can be found with the search functionality.
